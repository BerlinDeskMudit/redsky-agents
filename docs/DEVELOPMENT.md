## Setup

- **Node.js 20 or newer** (the repo ships a `.nvmrc`; run `nvm use`).
- **The OpenCode CLI** on your `PATH` — Red Sky needs a real runtime to do anything beyond rendering the shell.
- A configured OpenCode provider, or the model picker will be empty.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xMudit/redsky-agents.git
cd redsky-agents
npm install          # also downloads the Electron binary (~100 MB)
npm start            # build + launch
```

`npm install` is the only setup step. There is no code generation, no database migration, and no environment
file to create.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm start` | `node build.mjs && vite build` then `electron .`. The app runs from `dist/`. |
| `npm run dev` | Alias of `npm start`. |
| `npm run build` | Build main + preload + renderer into `dist/` without launching. |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` across `electron/`, `renderer/src/`, `shared/`, and `test/`. |
| `npm test` | Bundle the suites and run them with `node --test`. |
| `npm run build:test` | Bundle `test/*.test.ts` into `build-tests/suite.test.cjs` without running anything. |

**There is no hot reload.** Every code change needs a rebuild and an app restart. `npm run build` alone is the
fast feedback loop for a typecheck-and-bundle sanity pass; CI runs exactly that.

## Build pipeline

| Output | Tool | Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dist/main.js` | esbuild (`build.mjs`) | Node 20, CommonJS | Entry `electron/main.ts`, bundles everything except `electron`. |
| `dist/preload.js` | esbuild (`build.mjs`) | Node 20, CommonJS | Entry `electron/preload.ts`, same externals. |
| `dist/renderer/` | Vite (`vite.config.ts`) | Browser ESM | Root is `renderer/`, `base: './'` so `file://` loading works, Tailwind 4 via its Vite plugin, `emptyOutDir` on. |

Main and preload are bundled rather than run from source because Electron loads a single JS file per process;
renderer code is bundled by Vite because it is a React app. `electron/**` may not use bundler-only imports that
ESM would need — keep to Node built-ins and `electron`.

The main process loads `dist/renderer/index.html` with `loadFile`, so a **relative** `base` is load-bearing.

## Conventions

The codebase is small and consistent; match what is there:

- **TypeScript is strict** (`strict: true`) and there are no `any`s in the tree — use `unknown` plus a narrow,
  as the existing modules do. Type-only imports use `import type`.
- **Formatting:** 2-space indentation, single quotes, **no semicolons**, trailing commas, ~120-column lines.
  There is no Prettier or ESLint config — `.editorconfig` encodes the whitespace rules, and review catches the
  rest. Please keep diffs formatting-neutral rather than reformatting files you aren't changing.
- **Exported functions carry explicit types**, including parameter and return types on stores and IPC
  handlers.
- **Comments explain intent, not mechanics.** The existing ones mark *why* something is unusual (a Windows
  fallback, a debounce, a reserved key) — keep that bar.
- **Errors are surfaced or deliberately dropped**, never silently ignored: user-visible failures set
  `bot.status = 'error'` with the server's message; logging and audit writes fail closed on purpose.
- **Renderer purity:** the renderer never touches Node, `fs`, or OpenCode. All capability flows through
  `window.redsky` and the typed wrapper in `renderer/src/api.ts`.

## Recipes

### Adding an IPC method

Four files, in this order:

1. **`shared/types.ts`** — add the method to the `RedSkyApi` interface and, if the renderer needs to react to
   it, a new member of the `EventEnvelope` union.
2. **`electron/main.ts`** — add an `ipcMain.handle('rs:yourThing', …)` in `wireIpc()`. Validate arguments here:
   this is the boundary, and the renderer is untrusted. Throw a plain `Error` with a user-readable message.
3. **`electron/preload.ts`** — expose it on the `redsky` object alongside its siblings. Nothing else crosses
   the bridge unless it is listed here; that allow-list is the security boundary.
4. **`renderer/src/api.ts`** — add a matching method to the `demoApi()` fallback so the UI still runs in a
   browser tab. Missing demo methods are the usual cause of "works in the app, crashes in the browser".

Then call it from the UI and push updates with `broadcast({ source: '…' })` if other windows or panels care.

### Adding a setting

1. Add the key to `AppSettings` in `shared/types.ts`.
2. Add it to `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` in `electron/settings.ts` **and** to `normalize()` in the same file, so a
   malformed value falls back instead of propagating. Mirror the default in `renderer/src/api.ts`.
3. Render a control in the Settings panel (`SettingsPanel` in `renderer/src/ui.tsx`). Settings are applied on
   Save, not on every keystroke.
4. If agents should read it, include it in `buildSystem()` in `electron/agent.ts`.

### Adding a store

Follow `electron/notices.ts`: a module-level `JsonStore<T>` over a file in `userData`, an exported
`createXStore()` returning `{ list, add, … }`, sizes capped, and a `persist()` called from every mutator.
Reads normalize; writes go through the atomic writer in `lib/persist.ts`. Register the new file in
[docs/CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md#data-locations) so users can find it.

## Debugging

- **Logs first.** `workspace/logs/app.ndjson` has structured main-process logs; `tools.ndjson` has every file
  and shell call an agent made; `server-*.info` records the OpenCode URL for each boot. Filter with `jq` — see
  [Logs](CONFIGURATION.md#logs).
- **OpenCode itself.** Run `opencode serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 4096` in a terminal and start Red Sky
  with `REDSKY_OPCODE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4096 npm start`. You get the server's own output and can hit its
  endpoints by hand.
- **DevTools.** The window is frameless and there is no DevTools accelerator wired up yet, so the current
  workaround is to add `mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools()` temporarily inside `createWindow()` in
  `electron/main.ts`. Adding a proper toggle is a welcome first PR.
- **UI without Electron.** Open `renderer/index.html` in a browser: `renderer/src/api.ts` falls back to
  `demoApi()` with in-memory fixtures, which is the fastest way to iterate on layout and styling.
- **Renderer events.** `window.redsky.onEvent(cb)` in DevTools shows the raw `EventEnvelope` stream.
- **App won't reach `online`.** The status bar carries the real error. 45 seconds and a timeout message means
  `opencode` was not found — set `OPENCODE_BIN` to an absolute path.

## Packaging and OS warnings

`npm start` runs the app from `dist/` through the locally installed Electron. There is **no packaging step
yet**: no `electron-builder`/`electron-forge` config, no installers, no code signing, and `build/icon.ico` is
the only platform icon.

That means:

- On Windows you may get a SmartScreen warning; use *More info → Run anyway*.
- On macOS the first launch of an unsigned Electron build may need **System Settings → Privacy & Security →
  Open Anyway**.
- The app reports as `Electron` in some OS surfaces, since it is not a signed bundle.

Packaging is on the [roadmap](../README.md#roadmap). If you want to take it on, keep the existing build
outputs as the input — `dist/main.js`, `dist/preload.js`, and `dist/renderer/` are the complete app.

If you add a packaging step, wire it to a new `npm run dist` script rather than changing `npm start`; the
current behavior is the documented developer loop and CI depends on it.

## Testing

Suites run on Node's built-in test runner — no Vitest, no Jest, no runtime TypeScript loader.

```bash
npm test              # bundle, then `node --test build-tests/suite.test.cjs`
npm run build:test    # bundle only, if you want to read the emitted file
```

Add a file at `test/<name>.test.ts` and it is picked up automatically; nothing else to register.

### How the harness works

`scripts/build-tests.mjs` discovers `test/*.test.ts`, generates one entry that imports them all, and bundles it
with esbuild to `build-tests/suite.test.cjs` (gitignored). Bundling buys three things:

- TypeScript and `electron/**` imports work directly, so tests exercise the real modules rather than copies.
- `electron` is aliased to the double in `test/stubs/electron.ts`, so a plain Node process can import code
  that normally only runs inside Electron.
- One explicit file path behaves identically on Node 20–24 and in every shell, with no glob expansion needed.

### Keep tests hermetic

`test/helpers.ts` hands each test its own `userData` directory. Call `useTempHome()` before constructing the
unit under test — the Electron double resolves `app.getPath('userData')` from `REDSKY_TEST_HOME` on every call
— and `cleanupTempHomes()` when the suite is done. A test must never read or write the real data directory.

Timers can be faked with the runner's own mocks, which is how a one-minute routine is tested without waiting a
minute:

```ts
it('fires a routine when its interval elapses', async (t) => {
  t.mock.timers.enable({ apis: ['setTimeout'] })
  // …schedule work, then:
  t.mock.timers.tick(MINUTE)
  await drainMicrotasks() // let the re-arm promise chain settle
})
```

### What is covered today

| Suite | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `test/policy.test.ts` | Every Auto Review pattern group × every mode, plus word-boundary, case, and empty-input behavior. |
| `test/remind.test.ts` | Reminder parsing — clock times, am/pm edges, intervals, the cancel phrases — and the label copy. |
| `test/scheduler.test.ts` | Schedule parsing (including the invalid inputs), routine CRUD, reminder dedupe, disk rehydration, firing, and `stop()`. |

### What still needs tests

| Module | Why it is worth testing |
| --- | --- |
| `electron/memory.ts` | `extractMemoryLines()` and the keyword scoring behind recall. |
| `electron/collab.ts` | Mention parsing with overlapping names and regex-escaping hazards. |
| `electron/tools.ts` | The destructive-command filter and the workspace path guard. |
| `electron/workspace.ts` | `diffSnaps()` (which compares size and mtime, not content) and `snapshotWorkspace()` limits. |
| `electron/lib/persist.ts` | Atomicity, corrupt-file fallback, and the Windows rename fallback. |
| `electron/store.ts` | The legacy `tasks.json` → `bots.json` migration. |

The agent and OpenCode layer (`electron/agent.ts`, `electron/server.ts`) needs a fake `/session` + `/event`
server before it can be tested meaningfully. That is the highest-value next project, and a good reason to
discuss the approach in an issue first.

CI runs `npm test` on all three platforms, so any new suite is gated from the moment it lands.
